REFACTORING
1. Make controllers skinnier

NEXT TO DOS
1. Accounts
- Can get paid out  

2. New campaign page
- Add controller action and logic
- form_for @campaign POST to my database
- Make sure campaign is attached to user (pass current user into the show page)
- Check whether the current_user has a stripe account [MODEL METHOD]
   - YES: Post form information
   - NO: Redirect? to Stripe Connect sign up page and save information in the database
- Save new campaign

3. Delete campaign
- Controller destroy action (@campaign.clear)
- Flash notice that campaign has been destroyed

4. End campaign
- Add ended section to the campaign index page
- Check whether the deadline is before or after today's date
- Add a method that checks

Steven and Jeff Help
- Other ways that I can flex the API more that would be impressive (use developer tools, coupons, etc.)
- The type of feedback I could give them that would resonate
- Steven: Flow of the program and whether I am putting stuff in the right places.


NEED HELP TO DOS
Higher
3. Making the graph render
2. How to do a flash message
1. How to use modules (including use of self) and where you can access methods defined in controller actions
-- How to fix CURRENT_USER issue (not avalable with stripe_oauth)
7. How to pass ruby objects to js (particularly stuff that's in the show page)
Lower
6. How to appropriately link up charge objects (Can't remember what this is)
4. Save stripe API keys appropriately (better understand ENV, etc.)
- How to seed data after it has already been seeded once
- How to do assignment

QUESTIONS
- Better understanding of where I can access methods from (e.g., current user - defined in application helpers)
- Difference between redirect and render

LONG LIST
High
1. Give backers refunds if the campaign fails (https://stripe.com/docs/refunds)

- Issue refunds through Stripe

2. Stripe Connect: Give payouts to creators
- On appropriate timeline
- Ideally happens automatically when the $ is raised
a. Register as a platform

3. Integrate some sort of other developer tools (https://stripe.com/works-with)

Medium
1. You can't contribute to your own project.
2. Authentication and access to only your own profile

Low
1. Check if campaign has ended and figure out what to show then
- Show status (ended versus active in your account page)
2. refunds
3. Coupons (rewards area)
4. CSS on contributions page

LESS IMPT QUESTIONS
3. How to do different foreign_keys (e.g., backers vs. users)
